# stock-valuator
A sample python program that calculates a company's stock price.

This is a sample python program that uses mocked data to calculate a companyâ€™s suggested stock price based on a 
version of the Terminal Value method. The stock data is parsed from mocked data stored in a json file found 
within the project. This mocked data is representing an API call that the program would make to a service that 
provides financial, economic, and stock datasets, such as Quandl. 

Note: This program uses false data and should not be used to predict actual stock prices.
